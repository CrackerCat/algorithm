//! Performance
//!
//! The running time of MSD string sort depends on the data.
//!
//! For random inputs, MSD string sort examines just enough
//! characters to distinguish among the keys, and the running
//! time is sublinear in the number of characters in the data
//! (it examines a small fraction of the input characters).
//!
//! In the worst case, MSD string sort examines all the characters
//! in the keys, so the running time is linear in the number of
//! characters in the data (like LSD string sort). A worst-case
//! input is one with all strings equal.
//!
//! Example-1 (best case, examines just 1 char to distinguish among the keys)
//! ["aaaaa", ... "zzzzz"]
//!
//! d = 0,
//! count = [
//!  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
//!  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
//!  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
//!  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

//! Example-2 (worst case, all strings equal, need check all chars):
//! ["aaaaa", ... "aaaaa"]
//!
//! The benchmark data of best and worst cases:
//!   test MSD_best_case      ... bench:         602 ns/iter (+/- 53)
//!   test MSD_worst_case     ... bench:       3,767 ns/iter (+/- 157)
//!
//! No absolute rules.
//! Some applications involve distinct keys that are well-modeled
//! by the random string model; others have significant numbers of
//! equal keys or long common prefixes, so the sort time is closer
//! to the worst case. Our license-plate-processing application, f
//! or example, can fall anywhere between these extremes: if our
//! engineer takes an hour of data from a busy interstate, there
//! will not be many duplicates and the random model will apply;
//! for a weekâ€™s worth of data on a local road, there will be numerous
//! duplicates and performance will be closer to the worst case.
