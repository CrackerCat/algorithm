//! LSD string sort
//!
//! The first string-sorting method that we consider is known
//! as least-significant-digit first (LSD) string sort. Consider
//! the following motivating application:
//! Suppose that a highway engineer sets up a device that records
//! the license plate numbers of all vehicles using a busy highway
//! for a given period of time and wants to know the number of
//! different vehicles that used the highway. As you know from
//! Section 2.1, one easy way to solve this problem is to sort the
//! numbers, then make a pass through to count the different values,
//! as in Dedup (page 490). License plates are a mixture of numbers
//! and letters, so it is natural to represent them as strings.
//! In the simplest situation (such as the California license
//! plate examples at right) the strings all have the same number
//! of characters. This situation is often found in sort
//! applicationsâ€”for example, telephone numbers, bank account numbers,
//! and IP addresses are typically fixed-length strings.
//!
//! If the strings are each of length W,
//! we sort the strings W times with key-indexed counting, using
//! each of the positions as the key, proceeding from right to left.

/// The LSD provides static methods for sorting an
/// array of w-character strings or 32-bit integers
/// using LSD radix sort.
const R_ASCII: usize = 256; // extend ASCII alphabet size
const BITS_PER_BYTE: usize = 8;
const R_I32: usize = 1 << BITS_PER_BYTE;
