//! CHAPTER 4
//! Representation alternatives.
//!
//! The next decision that we face in graph processing is which
//! graph representation (data structure) to use to implement
//! this API. We have two basic requirements:
//!   - We must have the space to accommodate the types of graphs
//!     that we are likely to encounter in applications.
//!   - We want to develop time-efficient implementations of Graph
//!     instance meth- odsâ€”the basic methods that we need to develop
//!     graph-processing clients.
//!
//! These requirements are a bit vague, but they are still helpful
//! in choosing among the three data structures that immediately
//! suggest themselves for representing graphs:
//!
//! - An adjacency matrix, where we main- tain a V-by-V boolean array,
//!   with the entry in row v and column w defined to be true if there is
//!   an edge adjacent to both vertex v and vertex w in the graph, and to
//!   be false otherwise. This representation fails on the first count graphs
//!   with millions of vertices are common and the space cost for the V 2 boolean
//!   values needed is prohibitive.
//!   Beyond these performance objectives, a detailed examination reveals other
//!   considerations that can be important in some applications. For example,
//!   allowing parallel edges precludes the use of an adjacency matrix, since
//!   the adjacency matrix has no way to represent them.
//!
//! - An array of edges, using an Edge class with two instance variables of type
//!   int. This direct representation is simple, but it fails on the second count
//!   implementing adj() would involve examining all the edges in the graph.
//!
//! - An array of adjacency lists, where we maintain a vertex-indexed array of
//!   lists of the vertices adjacent to each vertex. This data structure satisfies
//!   both requirements for typical applications and is the one that we will use
//!   throughout this chapter.
