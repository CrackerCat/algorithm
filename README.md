### Introduction

My journey of algorithm in Rust.

Keywords: Algorithm, LeetCode, Rust

### Why Rust

1. excellent language, std, docs, crates, [IDE](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust)
2. cargo test
3. cargo bench

All of these features become powerful tools for developing algorithms.

### Running

```
# setup Rust Toolchain
make test
```
